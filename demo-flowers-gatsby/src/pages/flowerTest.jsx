             <div><p>Stonecrop is an outstanding Sedum cultivar that is exceptionally drought-resistant. Once you have planted these perennials properly, they will easily last over half the year in your garden. Stonecrop will grow up to two feet and has a variety of shades from pink to purple and even dark red or white. Not only will this plant look great in the garden, but it attracts bees and butterflies. At the same time, other critters such as deer or rabbits generally leave them alone.</p>
